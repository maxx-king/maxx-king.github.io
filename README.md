# 💫 About
Hey there, thanks for checking out the code behind my online portfolio! This project is always evolving and may not be in a presesntable state (sorry). I implemented wide array of front-end skills when building this site to demonstrate as much expertise, across various tools and technologies, as possible due to limitations with hosting.
